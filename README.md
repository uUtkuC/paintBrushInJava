This is a project I completed during my 2nd semester in the university.
I really enjoyed coding it hope you enjoy using it too:)
- important note: I highly reccomend that you run this code on linux. I tried running it both in windows and in linux, and linux one seemed very smooth almost like real paint. However windows one has a bug that causes whole page to go white for a moment during the shape sizing operations and truthfully it is slightly annoying.
   
This is an application that uses GUI's in java.
It allows you to draw rectangles, ovals and draw with pen. 
You can move previously drawn shapes.
The shape that you draw last or move last is seen at the top of other shapes.
How to use:
Choose a color by clicking the colors on top of the screen.
Choose the buttons to decide in which format you want to draw.
By default color Black is assigned. However no drawing format is assigned.
Therefore you need to pick one of the 3 options before you start to draw.
You can change the size of the screen as you see fit.
Have fun!
