This is an application that uses GUI's in java.
It allows you to draw rectangles, ovals and draw with pen. 
You can move previously drawn shapes.
The shape that you draw last or move last is seen at the top.
How to use:
Choose a color by clicking the colors on top of the screen.
Choose the buttons to decide in which format you want to draw.
By default color Black is assigned. However no drawing format is assigned.
Therefore you need to pick one of the 3 options before you start to draw.
You can change the size of the screen as you see fit.
Have fun!
